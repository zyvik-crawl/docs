This article suggests a half to three quarters of a teaspoon of iodized salt is necessary to get sufficient iodine. A teaspoon of table salt provides 2300g of sodium, or roughly the full RDA for an adult. A lower sodium intake is better for cardiovascular health, and people with high blood pressure definitely benefit from cutting their sodium to 500g/day. Question: is there a better way to provide iodine than expecting people to consume all that sodium? bigiain 1 minute ago | parent | context | on: Ross Ulbricht granted a full pardon So \"parked\" rather than \"hidden\" then.

As for this case though... the pardon does not make Ulbritch innocent! On the contrary, accepting the pardon implies guilt. So the pardon need not and might not extend to forfeitures. Though it's also possible that the presidential pardon could extend to the forfeitures, but I suspect that's a constitutional grey area. caspper69 1 minute ago | parent | context | on: Liskov Substitution: The real meaning of inheritan... Respectfully, I think you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. I read your story, and I can certainly empathize. But just because someone has made a tangled web using inheritance doesn't mean inheritance itself is to blame. Show me someone doing something stupid with inheritance and I can demonstrate the same stupidity with composition. I mean, base classes should not be operating on derived class objects outside of the base class interface, like ever. That's just poorly architected code no matter which way you slice it. But just like Dijkstra railing against goto, there is a time and a place for (measured, intelligent &amp; appropriate) use. Even the Linux kernel uses subclassing extensively. Sometimes Struct B really is a Struct A, just with some extra bits. You shouldn't have to duplicate code or nest structures to attain those ergonomics. Anything can lead to a rube-goldberg mess if not handled with some common sense. wahern 2 minutes ago | parent | context | on: Ross Ulbricht granted a full pardon This cuts both ways as judges often adjust their sentencing downward based on mitigating evidence. For both aggravating and mitigating circumstances evidence does need to be submitted, and there are standards of proof to be applied. It's just that the procedural rules can be different and, depending on the context and jurisdiction, sufficiency can be decided by the judge alone. In some jurisdictions aggravating evidence may need to be put to the jury, while mitigating evidence need not be. The U.S. is rather unique in providing a right to jury trials for most--in practice almost all, including misdemeanor--criminal cases. And this is a major factor for why sentencing is so harsh and prosecutions so slow in the U.S. In myriad ways the cost of criminal trials has induced the system to arrive at its current state. Be careful about what kind \"protections\" you want to impose. girvo 2 minutes ago | parent | context | on: Calm tech certification \"rewards\" less distracting... &gt; and so will sometimes absentmindedly snoop through what I've written if I leave it unattended I'm glad I'm not the only one who experienced that!

It isn't just job ads. For half the schools there was a formal definition. Also it has this part: \"In 2001, NSF and NIH established a formal postdoc definition as “an individual who has received a doctoral degree (or equivalent) and is engaged in a temporary and defined period of mentored advanced training to enhance the professional skills and research independence needed to pursue his or her chosen career path.” And yes you should expect to receive training. In the sense that you have a right to it and the supervisor has an obligation to provide it. You seem to be mistaking my criticisms of these jobs for defenses of them. remram 4 minutes ago | parent | context | on: \"...I'm a course designer for PGA2k23\" What does that mean?

Yes, because if someone has a tool that creates \"something incredible\", then everyone will be able to generate \"something incredible\" and then it all becomes not incredible. It's like having god-mode in a game, it all becomes boring very quickly when you can have whatever you want. titzer 4 minutes ago | parent | context | on: Liskov Substitution: The real meaning of inheritan... &gt; Don't ever use inheritance. Instead of things inheriting from other things, flip the relationship and make things HAVE other things. This is called composition and it has all the positives of inheritance but none of the negatives. Bah. There are completely legitimate uses of inheritance where it's a really great fit. I think you'll find that being dogmatic about avoiding a programming pattern will eventually get you twisted up in other ways. Inheritance can be used in a couple of ways that achieve a very-specific kind of code reuse. While I went through the early 2000's Java hype cycle with interfaces and factories and builders and double-dispatch and visitors everywhere, I went through a period where I hated most of that crap and swore to never use the visitor pattern again. But hey, within the past two years I found an unbeatable use case where the visitor pattern absolutely rocks (it's there: https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine/blob/master/src/util... ). If you can come up with another way by which you can deal with 550 different kinds of animals (the Wasm instructions) and inherit the logic for 545 and just override the logic for 5 of them, then be my guest. (And yes, you can use ADTs and pattern-matching, which I do, liberally--but the specifics of how immediates and their types are encoded and decoded just simply cannot be replicated with as little code as the visitor pattern). So don't completely swear off inheritance. It's like saying you'll never use a butter knife because you only do pocket knives. After all, butter knives are dull and not good for anything but butter. lordswork 4 minutes ago | parent | context | on: Ask HN: Is anyone doing anything cool with tiny la... well, what are the ideas? downrightmike 4 minutes ago | parent | context | on: Pls add dark-mode to news.Y Combinator.com Yeah, most of us just use filters: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29547363 8n4vidtmkvmk 4 minutes ago | parent | context | on: I'll think twice before using GitHub Actions again Turns out it does, actually. hg ci -m \"empty commit\" --config ui.allowemptycommit=1 From https://stackoverflow.com/a/71428853 .
