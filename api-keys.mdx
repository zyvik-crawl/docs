An API key is required to use Zyvik. The API key is used to authenticate your API requests.

To obtain an API key, you need to [sign up](https://dashboard.zyvik.com) and [create a new API key.](https://dashboard.zyvik.com/keys)

You can create unlimited API keys in your account.

You need to include "x-zyvik-api-key" in your API request header in order to authenticate.

```json
--header 'x-zyvik-api-key: zv-<YOUR API KEY>'
```

## Unauthorized Error

If the API failed to authenticate your API request, it will return 401 error code.

```json
{
    "error": "Unauthorized",
    "details": "Invalid or wrong API key. Please check https://docs.zyvik.com/api-key"
}
```

This means the API key is wrong or doesn't exist. Make sure you copy and paste your API key that can be found on [https://dashboard.zyvik.com/keys](https://dashboard.zyvik.com/keys). Your API keys should start with zv-

Your API keys should be confidential. Do not upload your API keys to public storage, Github or client side code. If you suspect your API key has been compromised, you can delete the API key in your dashboard.
