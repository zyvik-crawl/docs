An API key is required to use Zyvik. The API key is used to authenticate your API requests.

To obtain an API key, you need to [sign up](https://dashboard.zyvik.com) and [create a new API key.](https://dashboard.zyvik.com/keys)

You can create unlimited API keys in your account.

You need to include "x-zyvik-api-key" in your API request header in order to authenticate.

```
x-zyvik-api-key: zv-<YOUR API KEY>
```

## Unauthorized Error

If the API failed to authenticate your API request, it will return 401 error code.

```
{
    "error": "Unauthorized",
    "details": "Invalid or wrong API key. Please check https://docs.zyvik.com/api-key"
}
```

This means the API key is wrong or doesn't exist. Make sure you copy and paste your API key that can be found on [https://dashboard.zyvik.com/keys](https://dashboard.zyvik.com/keys). Your API keys should start with zv-
